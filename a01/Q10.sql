# For each customer market segment, list the:
# 1. market segment
# 2. cumulative order price for orders of status 'F' made by customers in that market segment
# 3. cumulative order price for orders of status 'O' made by customers in that market segment
# 4. cumulative order price for orders of status 'P' made by customers in that market segment
# The cumulative order prices should be cast as DECIMAL(11,2) and given the output names total_F, total_O, and total_P, respectively. Order the result by market segment.
# Hint: Try to use the divide and conquer approach and think of dividing the task into smaller tasks. Then use the results as intermediate tables to build a larger query! Note that this is a difficult question and there are many ways of handling this task. You are free to read up on external resources and utilize SQL commands/syntax not taught in the course. Part of this exercise is for you to discover the most suitable approach and method available in SQL to generate the report requested.
