# The management team wants a list of nations whose sales have been underperforming. Print out the list of nation names along with the total number of orders placed by customers from those nations but only for nations that have below average number of orders compared to all other nations.
# Note: You may not hard code the average number of orders per nation in the query! Your query must find the average number of orders per nation and then compare it to the totals for each nation to create a list of nations underperforming the average sales figure.
# Hint: You should first write a query that finds out the average number of sales per nation. Then wrap it in a larger query to get the final answer.
